In **pooling**, we downsample the image to make it smaller. This is accomplished by replacing a \(N \text{x} N\) block in the image with a \(M \text{x} M\) block, where \(M < N\), but the smaller block contains the most important information from the larger block.

Which of the following values of \(M\) and \(N\) will result in the greatest reduction in image size?


We can apply the concept of striding from convolutions to max pooling as well.

Suppose that \(N = 3\), \(M = 1\), and our stride is \(S = 2\). If we have a \(45 \text{x} 25 \text{x} 3\) input image, what will be the number of pixels in the downsampled image after applying this pooling operation?


We now introduce two different methods for performing this downsampling.

In **average pooling**, an \(N \text{x} N\) area is mapped to a single pixel, with value
